# AI2_MarsRoverPlanning

Project developed for the Artificial Intelligence 2 course at UniGe.
The aim of this project was to develop a pddl domain and problem for a mars rover which has to compute acquisitions of soil samples, analyze it and send the results to the earth base.
The rover is equipped with a series of advanced sensors (including spectrometers, multispectral cameras and radar for analysis activities, and stereoscopic cameras and IMU for navigation) and sophisticated data processing capabilities.

## Actions Implemented

### Activate_pos_sensor(base, IMU, stereocamera)
This action is used to activate the sensors used for navigation. This action can only be activated when the rover is in the base.
